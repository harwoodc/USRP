            <h2>Coach Debi</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Florida, Coach Debi began swimming as early as 10 months old during survival swim classes and later joined the Daytona Beach YMCA Swim Team.  During this time she competed in the Sunshine State Games and Junior Olympics for multiple years and also participated in the Volusia County Junior Lifeguard program. After earning a degree in communications at Thomas Edison State University, she worked overseas as an English teacher in China.  After marrying her Canadian husband Ben and settling in Canada, Coach Debi worked as a collegiate academic coach and as the coach trainer.  A fortuitous job for Ben brought Debi and their four children back to the Daytona Beach area, where their older two children began in the USRP Itsy Bitsy group.  Now all four children are USRP Racers, and Coach Debi has joined the coaching staff, working primarily with beginning Little Racers.  Swimming is a lifelong passion for her, and she incorporates it into her daily workout.  In addition to coaching for USRP, Coach Debi currently runs her own fine art wedding photography business.  Her homeschooling family loves exploring, beach going, family-room dancing, traveling, campfire singing, hiking, and, of course…swimming.  Inspiring young children towards a lifelong love for swimming is close to her heart.  Sports are fun, but often end once we reach adulthood.  Coach Debi sees swimming as the ideal lifelong fitness sport.</p>

            <h2>Coach Caleb</h2>
            <p>Coach Caleb Harwood decided to begin swimming during his eighth grade year in school after a productive summer of surfing.  He was surprised to find that he “nearly started to drown.”  His path soon crossed with Coach Anne Grams, who started Caleb on the way to a successful swimming career with Seabreeze High School.  Caleb says that he had never loved any sport until he started swimming but soon became hooked.  Enjoying helping his friends with strokes, turns, and starts led Caleb to complete the training process as a certified USA Swimming coach.   Coach Caleb is a favorite with the USRP Itsy Bitsy and Little Racers. He is also a Red Cross lifeguard and water safety instructor.   Caleb is currently working on a biology and psychology degree.  His other passions are peanut butter and his dog Duke.

            <h2>Coach Lyndsey</h2>
            <p>Growing up, Coach Lyndsey Allender has many fond memories of swimming, snorkeling, waterskiing, and white-water rafting, which is one reason coaching for USRP is a great fit for her.

She and her husband Jim own a small business, and Lyndsey homeschools their two boys, Blake and Will, who are avid USRP team members. One of her favorite places to be is rooting for her kids at a swim meet where swimmers can achieve as a team and as individual athletes. Coach Lyndsey’s favorite moments are shared with her family around the family breakfast table or exploring life together through travel, hiking, snow skiing, sharing a book, and laughing loudly. She is a coach member of USA Swimming.
